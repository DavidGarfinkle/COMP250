Introduction to Computer Science taught by Doina Precup in Winter 2014

Assignment_2:

Recursion.java is a simple algorithm which takes in an integer n and returns the number of binary strings of length n that do not have two consecutive 0's. 
For example: n=4 will return 111, 1110, 1101, 1011, 1010, 0111, 0110, 0101.


Assignment_3:

Pascal.java takes in two integers m,n and returns the integer in the mth column of the nth row in pascal's triangle:
1
11
121
1331
...

StacksandQueues.java contains two methods. One can reverse a queue and the other can copy a stack.

quickSort.java implements the quicksort algorithm for an array of elements
mergeSort.java implements the mergesort algorithm for an array of elements (provided by professor)
SortBenchmark.java compares the runtime of quicksort and mergesort with some random set of integers.


Assignment_5:

TileBoard.java contains an 8-sliding tile puzzle constructor as well as a possible move-generator method and a Manhattan distance calculator method
SlidingSolver.java solves the puzzle and returns the move path required to win the 8-sliding tile puzzle game
SlidingSolverDriver.java --> provided by professor
SlidingSolution.java --> provided by professor
